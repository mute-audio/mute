         <h3>A Simple RPi-Audio/ MPD Dashboard [ ver.${VER} ]</h3>
         <br>
         <p class="bodytext2">
         This WebApp is designed ONLY to work to set up the "RPi-Audio Player", NOT to browse / play your music library.
         To control MPD, you can use the Client App ( like <a href="https://www.openaudiolab.com/yampc/" target="_blank">yaMPC</a> ) installed on your mobile or tablet.
         <br>
         This WebAPP is released as "A Freeware" under the MIT License.
         <br>
         </p>

         <br>
         <div class="separator"><hr></div>

         <h2>How to set-up</h2>
         <p class="bodytext2">
         <br>
         It consists of the following five sections, which can be accessed from the menu tabs on the left.
         By setting up a section-by-section, you will be able to build "RPi Audio Player" without any knowledge of terminal or Linux commands.
         </p>

         <br>
         <h3>Step 0 : Choose and install MPD</h3>
         <p class="bodytext2">
         On first launch, MPD is not yet installed, so you will first need to select and install the MPD package.
         Choose the MPD package and install it; "an official" Debian version or an "unofficial" Backports version by the MPD project.
         <br>
         </p>

         <br>
         <h3>Step 1 : RaspberryPi</h3>
         <p class="bodytext2">
         The first step is to configure the basic settings for the RaspberryPi.
         <br>
         Configure the time zone, WiFi, and other settings.
         At the same time, you can check the status of the RaspberryPi board, including its model name, CPU temperature, and RaspberryPi OS version.
         Also refer to this menu when you want to power off or reboot.
         <br>
         </p>

         <br>
         <h3>Step 2 : Sound Device</h3>
         <p class="bodytext2">
         The next step is to configure the sound devices such as the DAC HAT and USB DAC.
         <br>
         The sound driver is ALSA, PulseAudio is not supported.
         USB DACs are automatically recognized when connected and are listed in the MPD settings in step 4,
         but DAC HATs that are connected to I2S using the GPIO port of the RasberryPi are not automatically recognized and need to be registered.
         Once registered, the sound device can be sound checked using the "speaker-test" command.
         <br>
         </p>

         <br>
         <h3>Step 3 : Source Volume</h3>
         <p class="bodytext2">
         Did you get any sound with Sound Check?
         <br>
         Next, use this form to register the NAS where your music library is stored.
         When the NAS is mounted successfully, [ mute ] will automatically create a symbolic link to the /music directory in MPD.
         If not, please check your SMB version. In most cases "vers=1.0" should work.
         <br>
         </p>

         <br>
         <h3>Step 4 : MPD</h3>
         <p class="bodytext2">
         Now it's time to set up MPD.
         After successful installation, you will be able to configure various settings.
         In particular, the ability to change the Decoder Plugin settings directly is an unique feature not found in other distributions.
         <br>
         </p>

         <br>
         <h3>Step 5 : Web Radio List</h3>
         <p class="bodytext2">
         Web Radio Streaming playlists can be registered on [ mute ].
         The destination of the list will be music directory (.../music/Web_Radio), so you can browse and play it with your client application.
         <br>
         A link to <a href="https://jcorporation.github.io/webradiodb/" target="_blank">[ webradiodb ]</a>, a database of web radio stations, is also provided.
         <br>
         </p>

         <br>
         <h3>Step 6 : Other Settings</h3>
         <p class="bodytext2">
         In this step,you can configure the following steps:
         <br> 1. Last.fm scribble settings
         <br> 2. Generate Coverart by getcover - get cover art image from music files ; FLAC, ALAC, and AAC
         <br> 3. Copy buttons for the host and server names for use with client apps such as yaMPC ( very useful to use on iPad )
         <br> 4. Dark Mode Switch
         <br> 5. System Startup Sound Switch
         <br>
         </p>
