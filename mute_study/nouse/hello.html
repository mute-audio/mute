   <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p class="bodytext">
    <br>
    Hello,
    <br>
    <br>
    If you are seeing this page, it means that [ mute ] has been successfully installed on your RaspberryPi.
    <br>
    This WebApp is designed ONLY to work to set up the "RPi-Audio Player", NOT to browse / play your music library.
    To control MPD, you need the Client App ( like <a href="https://www.openaudiolab.com/yampc/" target="_blank">yaMPC</a> ) installed on your mobile or tablet. 
    It consists of the following five sections, which can be accessed from the menu tabs on the left.
    By configuring the settings in order from the top, you will be able to build "RPi Audio Player" without any knowledge of terminal or Linux commands.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Step 1 : RaspberryPi</h3>
     <p class="bodytext">
       The first step is to configure the basic settings for the RaspberryPi.
       <br>
       Configure the time zone, WiFi, and other settings.
       At the same time, you can check the status of the RaspberryPi board, including its model name, CPU temperature, and RaspberryPi OS version.
       Also refer to this menu when you want to power off or reboot.
       <br>
     </p>

     <br>
     <h3>Step 2 : Sound Device</h3>
     <p class="bodytext">
       The next step is to configure the sound devices such as the DAC HAT and USB DAC.
       <br>
       The sound driver is ALSA, PulseAudio is not supported.
       USB DACs are automatically recognized when connected and are listed in the MPD settings in step 4,
       but DAC HATs that are connected to I2S using the GPIO port of the RasberryPi are not automatically recognized and need to be registered.
       Once registered, the sound device can be sound checked using the "speaker-test" command.
       <br>
     </p>

     <br>
     <h3>Step 3 : Source Volume</h3>
     <p class="bodytext">
       Did you get any sound with Sound Check?
       <br>
       Next, use this form to register the NAS where your music library is stored.
       When the NAS is mounted successfully, [ mute ] will automatically create a symbolic link to the /music directory in MPD.
       If not, please check your SMB version. In most cases 'vers=1.0' should work.
       <br>
     </p>

     <br>
     <h3>Step 4 : MPD</h3>
     <p class="bodytext">
       Now it's time to set up MPD.
       However, MPD is not yet installed, so you will first need to select and install the MPD package. 
       Choose the MPD package and install it; there is an official RaspberryPi OS version and an "unofficial" version recommended by the MPD project. 
       After successful installation, you will be able to configure various settings.
     <br>
     </p>
     
     <br>
     <h3>Step 5 : Other Settings</h3>
     <p class="bodytext">
       In this step, you can do two things:
   <br> 1. Last.fm scribble settings
   <br> 2. Copy buttons for the host and server names for use with client apps such as yaMPC ( very useful to use on iPad )
       <br>
     </p>

     <br>
     <h3>That's it.</h3>
     <p class="bodytext">
       If you've set it up this far, you should be able to play your library or web radio from your Raspy audio system.
       But don't forget to use a client app such as yaMPC, as it doesn't have library browsing or playback capabilities.
       <br>
